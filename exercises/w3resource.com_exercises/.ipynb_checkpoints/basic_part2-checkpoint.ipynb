    "Second Day of July 1776, will be the most memorable Epocha, in the History of America.\"\n",
    "But Independence Day is actually celebrated on July 4, the date that the Declaration of\n",
    "Independence was approved.\n",

    "After ratifying the text on July 4, Congress issued the Declaration of Independence in\n",

    "Declaration to be the foundation of his political philosophy and argued that it is a statement of principles\n",
